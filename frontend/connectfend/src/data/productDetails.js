    description: `
    Wired remote reading gas meter adopts M-BUS or RS485 Modbus 
    communication to enable remote meter reading and valve control. 
    It measures gas flow in pipelines and is equipped with a microcomputer 
    to store gas consumption, detect battery status, and monitor meter operation. 
    It helps utilities improve billing efficiency and eliminates the need 
    for manual meter reading.

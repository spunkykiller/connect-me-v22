It combines precise ultrasonic measurement and automatic flow control in one compact unit, removing the need for external balancing or control valves. With no moving parts, it delivers high accuracy, stable low-flow performance, and long service life. The integrated valve supports dynamic balancing, flow limitation, and on/off control to reduce energy waste and improve system efficiency. It is suitable for heating, cooling, and combined energy applications, with intelligent firmware compliant with EN1434. Designed for smart buildings, it supports M-Bus, RS-485, NB-IoT, and wireless M-Bus for AMR and BMS integration. Built-in Power Control and Delta-T management further optimize coil performance and overall plant efficiency.",

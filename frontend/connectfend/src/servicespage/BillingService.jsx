                            over the internet. Billing system is a combination of software and
                            hardware that receives service usage information, groups this
                            information for specific accounts or customers, produces invoices,
                            creates reports for management, and records (posts) payments made to
                            customer accounts.

                                After an invoice is generated and dispatched to the customer, ideally,

                                may be some customers, who do not pay their bills and there may be an
                                unacceptable delay in paying the bill and hence the service providers
                                must take some action needed to remedy the situation and collect the
                                outstanding balance due.

                                Collection is the process of chasing past due receivables on customer
                                account. This usually involves sending notifications to the customer
                                and taking appropriate actions in absence of due payments after the
                                due date.
